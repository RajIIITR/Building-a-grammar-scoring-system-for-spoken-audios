audio_1163.wav,5.0,My most important goal in life is to build a life for my two daughters that is full of happiness and joy. It's important to me because my girls are everything to me and I love them more than anything in life. The challenges that I face are making sure that we have enough money to live the life that we want to live and with that making sure that I then have enough time to spend that time with them. spend that time with them as obviously in order to make that money I have to work so being able to be with them is a challenge with that because work obviously takes time. In terms of what motivates me to stay focused and determined on that path it's just seeing the joy in their faces and seeing them become everything that they want to be and making sure that they can have that success and grow up to be really happy independent and knowing that they knowing that they are loved little girls.
